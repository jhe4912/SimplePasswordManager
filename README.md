# SimplePasswordManager
A project. Not a actual password manager you should rely on.

How to setup and test:
-	Obtain and extract “SimplePasswordManager.zip”. The zip file can be found through the release page on GitHub (https://github.com/jhe4912/SimplePasswordManager/releases/tag/Release)
    -	Extracted contents should be a folder holding SimplePasswordManager.jar, windows_start.bat, and windows_start_with_debug.bat.
-	Starting the program:
    -	For Windows:
        -	You can start the program through navigating to the extracted folder via command prompt and starting with the command “java -jar SimplePasswordManager.jar” or start the program using the “windows_start.bat” file.
      -	For Other OS:
        -	You will need to start the program from your OS command-line program using “java -jar SimplePasswordManager.jar” after changing.
      -	Extra arguments those using command-line:
        -	-debug
            -	This will enable exception error printouts to be printed.
        - -showpassword
            -	This will allow you see what you typed when entering passwords.
